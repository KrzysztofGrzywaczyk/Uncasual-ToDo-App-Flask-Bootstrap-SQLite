# About this web app:



**Web ToDo-type aplication,** where user is able to:

- Add a new task
- Mark task as completed and reverse this process.
- Archive Completed tasks to another section and restores them
- Delete tasks completely

Created using flask micro-freamwork and SQLAlchemy to connect to SQLite database
and also Bootstrap for stylistic purposes.
