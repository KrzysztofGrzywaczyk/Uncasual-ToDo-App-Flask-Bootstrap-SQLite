# About this web app:

Uncasual, **Web Task-managment-type aplication,** where user is able to:

- Add a new task
- Edit name, description and status of the task
- Mark task as completed and reverse this process
- Archive Completed tasks to another section and restores them to the main one
- Delete tasks completely from both section-levels

Created using flask micro-freamwork and SQLAlchemy to connect to SQLite database
and also Bootstrap for stylistic purposes and flash comunicates.
